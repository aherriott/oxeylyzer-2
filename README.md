## This analyzer is still in early development!!!

try it out on the web: https://o2.oxey.dev/

## Repl usage:

If you have rust installed, simply run `cargo run -r` in the root directory. To change the corpus,
weights or other things (more will be included later), take a look at the `analyzer-config.toml`.
Trigram weights currently exist but are not used in scoring or generation :innocent:
